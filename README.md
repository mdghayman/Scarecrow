# Scarecrow
Scarecrow offers low code web development for data science.

## Introduction
Existing web development platforms don't offer what the data science community needs:
* Python-based frameworks like Flask and Django require additional learning: even if you understand Python and its ecosystem, you still need to learn more about HTML, CSS, HTTP requests, and routing infrastructure.
* All-python alternatives like Streamlit offer limited personalisation and limited support for infrstructure like multiple pages, user authentication, and session tracking.
Scarecrow offers a fully customisationbale framework for building data science apps, which works out of the box and will be free forever.

## Ethos
The lines between open source and traditional companies have blurred, but successful organisations have remained able to deliver and maintain high quality software, regardless of their financial structure. I'm indebted to the fine people at Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, MLflow, Git, GitHub, iPython, Jupyter, and many others. As a way of honouring them, I commit to developing and maintaining Scarecrow as as far as feasible for no payment and in the interests of furthering the development of data science.

## Team
Scarecrow was established by Michael Hayman, who is fully responsible for its development and maintenance. If you would like to contribute to Scarecrow, please email mdghayman@gmail.com to share your proposal and your background.
